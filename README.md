> In the included *Winning Lines* video, the symbol set was intentionally reduced to increase the visibility of winning line patterns. This was done to better illustrate the paylines during testing and is **not reflective of standard game odds**. The full symbol set is used during normal gameplay.



## üôè Big Thanks

Special thanks to the following creators for their invaluable tutorials and insights:

- [**NotaSWE**](https://www.youtube.com/@NotaSWE) ‚Äì for insightful explanations on **delta time** and **system design**, which greatly improved the structure and performance of this project.

- [**Clear Code**](https://www.youtube.com/@ClearCode) ‚Äì for their incredible **Pygame tutorials**, which provided a solid foundation and inspiration throughout the development process.


> The idea for this project originated from a random [**NotaSWE**](https://www.youtube.com/@NotaSWE) video, where the concept of **delta time** was explained ‚Äî this turned out to be crucial for creating smooth animations. I also adopted his **system design** approach when starting the project.


## üí° My Contribution  

Building upon that foundation, i implemented several unique features to make the slot machine feel more interactive, flexible, and visually engaging:

- üéØ **Dynamic gameplay mechanics** ‚Äî Change bet size and number of lines during gameplay using arrow keys. No need to modify the code to play differently.
- üß† **Custom line system** ‚Äî Lines are implemented programmatically, with logic that checks for winning combinations across any defined set of lines.
- üí∞ **Jackpot logic** ‚Äî A random spin counter triggers a jackpot win to simulate rarity and add excitement.
- üìà **Dynamic payout adjustment** ‚Äî Win payouts scale according to the number of active lines, encouraging strategic play.
- üè∑Ô∏è **Symbol-based payout table** ‚Äî Each symbol pays out a different multiplier of the player's bet per winning line.  
  The payout structure is defined by:
  ```python
  SYMBOL_PAYTABLE = {
      "cherry": 1.2,    # 120% of bet per winning line
      "seven": 10,      # 1000% of bet
      "bar": 5.0,       # 500% of bet
      "diamond": 2.5,   # 250% of bet
      "clover": 1.8     # 180% of bet
  }
  ```
  This allows for easy adjustment of game balance and introduces more excitement with rare, high-paying symbols.
- üîÄ **Customizable paylines** ‚Äî You can define your own lines for the slot machine.  
    There are now **37** total paylines included by default, supporting a wide variety of patterns including straight, diagonal, zig-zag, and V-shapes.  
    Example:
  ```python
  PAYLINES = [
      ...
      [(1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4)],  # second_row
      [(0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4)],  # first_row
      [(2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 4)],  # third row
      [(0, 0), (1, 1), (2, 2), (1, 3), (0, 4)],  # V - shape
      [(2, 0), (1, 1), (0, 2), (1, 3), (2, 4)],  # V - shape upside down
      ...
  ]
  ```
  You can add, remove, or modify these lines in the code to create your own unique slot machine experience.
- üéûÔ∏è **Enhanced animations** ‚Äî Added animations to improve visual feedback and player experience:
  - Animated **coin bursts** when a jackpot is hit
  - **Line highlighting animations** for multiple line wins
  - **Screen shake** and **flashing transparency effects** to emphasize big wins

These additions are designed to make the game not just a technical demo, but a playable and engaging slot machine experience.

## üïπÔ∏è Controls

- **‚Üê Left Arrow** ‚Äì Decrease bet  
- **‚Üí Right Arrow** ‚Äì Increase bet  
- **‚Üë Up Arrow** ‚Äì Increase number of active lines  
- **‚Üì Down Arrow** ‚Äì Decrease number of active lines

## üé® Image Customization
> üñºÔ∏è You're free to replace or modify the symbol images however you like ‚Äî just make sure they are in `.png` format **with a transparent background** so visual effects render properly. Pygame will automatically scale them to fit the defined dimensions:
>
> ```python
> SYMBOL_WIDTH = 240
> SYMBOL_HEIGHT = 200
> ```

## ‚öôÔ∏è Requirements

- Python 3 is required.

Install dependencies (recommended):
```sh
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Or install Pygame only:
